E Commerce Website which provides recommendations using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

This project helped me and my team to win the thrid price in the Need for Code Hackathon organised by TSEC CodeTantra.
We were the only team selected under the AI/ML domain in the winners list.

NOTE:-

The implemented model is a python jupyter notebook of the name recommendations-MT.

The website designed is just for reference and a fair idea of howw the model will work once implemented in a website.
